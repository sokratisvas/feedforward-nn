# A Feedforward Neural Net from scratch
A Feedforward Neural Net used to classify the Iris Dataset. You can find the Iris Species Dataset 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). This Neural Net was implemented for educational purposes in order to understand Backpropagation. 

You can experiment with the ```learning rate ```, number of ```epochs```, number of ```neurons per layer``` and the type of ```loss function``` (Mean Square or Categorical Cross Entropy).
# Quick Start
Run the Neural Net with:
```bash
$ sh run_nn.sh
```
